My name is Nikhil Kadiyan and I have completed my B.Tech from the National Institute of Technology Delhi with a CGPA of 8.44. I have been working with ThoughtSpot India Pvt Ltd, first as a Software Engineering Intern and now as a Member of Technical Staff. My experience there has given me the skills and knowledge needed for this role.

At ThoughtSpot, I have worked on several key features of the product. I have collaborated with team members on the Filter and Sort feature for worksheet tables and columns, which involved updating APIs to include tags, authors, and database information. I also implemented Knowledge Cards that provide users with essential information about selected tables. I migrated the schema viewer from Angular to React, creating new React components and making GraphQL calls to the backend. This migration involved solving various design issues in the old UI.

I have a strong commitment to accessibility, demonstrated by my work on improving the accessibility of ThoughtSpotâ€™s website. I implemented over 50 accessibility improvements, ensuring that the website is compliant with WAI-ARIA and WCAG international standards. This initiative has made the website accessible to users who rely on keyboard navigation and screen readers.

In my personal projects, I have developed a Golang Cloth Management API, a Golang Terminal News Reader, a Real-Time Chatroom Application, and Photogram, an image-sharing social media platform. These projects highlight my ability to create reliable and scalable applications, implement secure authentication, and develop user-friendly interfaces.

My technical skills include Python, C++, Java, Go, SQL, and TypeScript. I am also proficient in frameworks such as ReactJS, NextJS, and Angular, and I am familiar with developer tools like Git, Heroku, Vercel, and Firebase.

In addition to my technical skills, I have solved over 400 Data Structures and Algorithm problems on Leetcode witha rating of 1545 in contests, and achieved a highest rating of 1708 on Codechef. These achievements reflect my analytical skills and dedication to continuous learning.

I am excited about the opportunity to bring my skills and experience to this company. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your team and discussing how my background aligns with your needs.
