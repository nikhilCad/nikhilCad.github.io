\pt Achieved a 90\% decrease in page load times by migrating the impressions database for the product's homepage from Munshi V1 to V2, achieved by changing the schema of the database\\
% MunshiV2 reduced time from 40 seconds to 2-3 seconds - db schema - instead of individual lookup we made it a single table
%ie previously it looked up all users who have viewed, now we made new table that had all the views
\pt Executed the handling of communication events as a multi tenant service as measured by the successful implementation of Slack event handling for all clusters within a tenant and making the app comply with Slack guidelines. \\
% COMS is multi tenant, buzzwords - AWS - Migrating to GCP to ave costs as package deal
\sectionsep

\position{Software Engineering Intern | React, Typescript, Playwright, Jest}{Jan '24 - Jun `24}
\pt Migrated schema viewer from Angular to React by creating new React components and making graphQL calls to the backend. Also helped to solve various design issues in old UI during migration\\
% Mention customer was Apple, and how old schema viewer was only because in angular we were taking in all data at once
% But now that data is separated into different requests which frontend combines to show the data
% Async rendering or whatever 
\pt Worked on \textbf{Filter and Sort feature} for worksheet tables and columns along with one team member. Collaborated with the backend team to update API to include \textbf{tags, authors and database info} to sort the tables.\\
\pt Implemented Knowledge Cards that tell users info about a selected table including database. schema, author etc. Made API calls to the backend\\
\pt Resolved \textbf{high priority bugs} in the existing code on a priority basis for the customer, with average time of 1-2 days to merge the changes into master. \textbf{Cherry picked} must fixes to already released software, added retroactively to older versions of product.\\
