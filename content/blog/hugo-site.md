A previous version of my portfolio was created using good old HTML and CSS, however editing that was turning out to be a chore. A wise man once said, **do not** reinvent the wheel, so I looked into the world of static site generators.

Stumbling upon Hugo, I saw that it already had a plethora of good themes. A quick scroll through the page and I finally settled on the amazing papermod theme at https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod

After some struggles figuring how hugo works, I have finally found a sweet spot where I can easily edit this portfolio without dealing with all the headaches of maintaining the CSS and styles and everything by myself.

I did have to make some tweaks to the papermod theme to accommodate the experience section.

Because of Hugo, I decided to add a blog section. Not sure what exactly should I put here, but I guess putting some neat tricks or projects I find for future me to see and remember is a good enough use.

**Do not reinvent the wheel**
