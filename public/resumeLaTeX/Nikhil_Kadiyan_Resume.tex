\position{ThoughtSpot | Member of Technical Staff 3 | Java, Golang, React, Typescript, GraphQL}{Aug '25 - Present | Hyderabad}
\pt Working on Integrating Thoughtspot's web plugins in \textbf{Google Slides, Sheets, Microsoft Excel and Powerpoint} to give customers a holistic view of their data within their preferred application.\\
\sectionsep

% Munshi -reduced load times -worked on trending
% MunshiV2 reduced time from 40 seconds to 2-3 seconds - db schema - instead of individual lookup we made it a single table
%ie previously it looked up all users who have viewed, now we made new table that had all the views - How we checked time
% taken? - Using tarcevault using the trace id of the request
% fixed many homepage bugs related to share api - discoverability unchecked, rate limit
% Wrote MANY E2Es to increase test coverage
% Added mixpanel events, fixed many mixpanel bugs firing at wrong time, fixed  mixpanel wrong display name
% Worked on share feature rate limit using Redis cache
% Fixed Apple security issues of removign cronJobExpression from sessioninfo
% To add - Edge onboarding
% Mid Year Review Jul24-Jan25 ThoughtSpot
% Epics
%  Accessibility - Worked on accessibility improvements for Growth components, asked by Bank of America, significant progress in enhancing accessibility features to ensure compliance and inclusivity.
%  Edge Onboarding - Creating a new onboarding flow which introduces Spotter and TSA to a first time free trial user of Thoughtspot - Aims to be first and reduce user dropout
%  Protractor to Playwright - Migrated protractor tests related to share and data access scenarios
%  Spotter Public API test cases - Wrote API test cases that check response for Spotter Public API
% Security
%  Implemented share limit in share feature using Redis
%  Apple security - Removed sensitive data from session info
% Others
%  Mode intercom - Added backend changes for Mode intercom
%  Mixpanel MTUs - Reduced Mixpanel MTUs in testing project 700k to 10k weekly users by identifying cases where Mixpanel should not be enabled
%  Only showing tags which user has access to ( Previously all tags were shown) 
%  Bug fixing / ops
% Munshi Org Aware - Made Cassandra database that handles our views org aware. Org are independent sheels within Thoughtspot
% KPI alerts for Slack
\position{ThoughtSpot | Member of Technical Staff 2 | Java, Golang, React, Typescript, GraphQL}{Jul '24 - Jul '25 | Hyderabad}
\pt Achieved a \textbf{90\% reduction in homepage load time} by migrating the internal Cassandra impressions database to a new schema, replacing per-view lookups with a unified table storing total views per user.\\
\pt Introduced \textbf{org awareness} to the trending table of \textbf{Cassandra} database by creating a new table with altered schema, allowing each isolated org in the instance to have separate trending objects.\\
\pt Executed team-led \textbf{zero downtime data migration} of \textbf{50M+} rows across clusters in \textbf{Cassandra} database by implementing a background script that safely transferred data and seamlessly switched over to the new schema.\\
\pt Redesigned the user onboarding to highlight \textbf{AI-powered Spotter}, guiding users through creating connections, importing data, and asking questions via natural language, resulting in improved feature adoption by 30\%.\\
\pt Addressed a \textbf{security vulnerability} in the share API by implementing a Redis-based rate limiter after penetration testing exposed a missing rate limit, effectively controlling API request rates and mitigating abuse risks.\\
\pt \textbf{Diagnosed and patched} a Mixpanel overtracking issue ahead of a renewal, \textbf{reducing test event volume by 98.5\% (20M to 300K)} and \textbf{saving \$30K}.\\ % 30 grand that might have gone for the new plan, we bought for 23K finally, else it would have been 50K range
\pt Added frontend support for \textbf{monitor alerts in Slack}, enabling users to receive data updates directly in Slack without opening the BI tool, increasing notification click rate by 20\%.\\
% \pt Executed the handling of communication events as a multi tenant service as measured by the successful implementation of Slack event handling for all clusters within a tenant and making the app comply with Slack guidelines. \\
% COMS is multi tenant, buzzwords - AWS - Migrating to GCP to ave costs as package deal

\position{ThoughtSpot | Software Engineering Intern | React, Typescript, Playwright, Jest}{Jan '24 - Jun '24 | Hyderabad}
\pt Migrated schema viewer from Angular to React by creating new React components and making GraphQL calls to the backend. Also rectified design issues in the legacy UI during migration.\\
% Mention customer was Apple, and how old schema viewer was only because in angular we were taking in all data at once
% But now that data is separated into different requests which frontend combines to show the data
% Async rendering or whatever 
% \textbf{Cherry picked} must fixes to already released software, added retroactively to older versions of product.
\pt Worked on \textbf{Filter and Sort features} for worksheet tables and columns along with one team member. Collaborated with the backend team to update the API to include \textbf{tags, authors, and database info} for sorting.\\
\pt Rolled out Knowledge Cards that show users information about a selected table including database, schema, and author. Made API calls to the backend.\\
\pt Resolved \textbf{critical customer-reported bugs}, with an average turnaround of 1-2 days to merge changes into master.\\
