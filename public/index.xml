      <title>How I made C&#43;&#43; readable to type in Competitive programming</title>

      <description>So I have started my competitive programming journey using Python instead of C++. And it was great! The one thing that I love the most about Python is how easily readable the code is. There are some great keywords like in and the beloved for i in range(start,end,step) whose value I did not realize until I started using C++. You start to appreciate the simplicity of print after writing your 5th &amp;lt;&amp;lt; in cout</description>

      <description>A previous version of my portfolio was created using good old HTML and CSS, however editing that was turning out to be a chore. A wise man once said, do not reinvent the wheel, so I looked into the world of static site generators.
Stumbling upon Hugo, I saw that it already had a plethora of good themes. A quick scroll through the page and I finally settled on the amazing papermod theme at https://github.</description>
